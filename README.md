This project involves building and evaluating a logistic regression model to classify data from the Hill Valley dataset. The dataset is loaded and initially inspected to understand its structure and contents. The features and target variable are separated, and the feature data is standardized. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained on the training data and used to predict the class labels for the test data. The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report. Additionally, the model is tested on a new, randomly selected sample from the dataset.
